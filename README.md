# Password-Generator

This is a simple password generator created using React. It allows you to generate strong, random passwords of a specified length and with optional requirements such as including numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters.

# Features
  - Generates a random password based on user-defined criteria:
      - Length (between 8 and 20 characters)
      - Character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters)
      - Copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.

# Usage
To use the password generator, simply adjust the length and requirements of your desired password using the input fields and checkboxes. Then, click the "Generate Password" button to create a new password. You can copy the generated password to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
